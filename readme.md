# This repository is no longer being used. 
The TFS Aggregator Webhooks solution has been merged back into [the tfsaggregator solution](https://github.com/tfsaggregator/tfsaggregator/tree/develop).

# TFS Aggregator Webhooks.
This is an alternative version of TFS Aggregator that supports [Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS)](https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/).
It can be used on premises also, starting from TFS 2015: you have to provide the hosting environment.
You can reuse the existing Rules with minimal changes.

> This is still a beta version, please provide feedback to the team!

## Example Uses

 - Update the state of a Bug, PBI (or any parent) to "In Progress" when a child gets moved to "In Progress"
 - Update the state of a Bug, PBI (or any parent) to "Done" when all children get moved to "Done" or "Removed"
 - Update the "Work Remaining" on a Bug, PBI, etc with the sum of all the Task's "Work Remaining".
 - Update the "Work Remaining" on a Sprint with the sum of all the "Work Remaining" of its grandchildren (i.e. tasks of the PBIs and Bugs in the Sprint).
 - Sum up totals on a single work item (i.e. Dev Estimate + Test Estimate = Total Estimate)
 - Create new work items
 - Create new work item links
